            <h2>[04/12/23] Hawking's radiation is not constant.</h2>
            
            <p>Hello there readers, won't you be surprised to know that black holes have to become bias for maintaining it's conservation of energy. Believe me it's more exciting then it sounds. This article is suitable for both science and non-science readers. You can skip the derivation or the formulas if you want as those are just for the people who really want to know what is the reason behind it. </p>

            <h4>What are "Hawking's Radiations" ?</h4>
            <p>Hawking radiation is the electromagnetic radiation given out by the just outer layer of the event horizon. Everything in this universe that has a temperature must emit electromagnetic radiation now as because black hole has a finite temperature, it must also radiate thermal radiation known as black body radiation.</p>

            <p>The idea behind Hawking radiation is rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics and the concept of virtual particles. According to quantum mechanics, particles and antiparticles can spontaneously appear and annihilate each other near the event horizon of a black hole. The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull.</p>
